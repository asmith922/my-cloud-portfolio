# My Cloud Portfolio

Hi! Iâ€™m Alex ðŸ‘‹ â€” Iâ€™m currently on a journey to pivot in my career from a non-technical role to a cloud role, focusing on Microsoft Azure as my CSP platform with a focus area of Security.

This repository is where Iâ€™ll document my hands-on learning â€” including Azure labs, Terraform practice, and architecture diagrams. The below Planned Focus Areas and Future Projects sections are subject to change whilst I get my GitHub Portfolio up and running, I'll update accordingly.

### ðŸ“˜ Planned Focus Areas
- Identity and Access (SC-300)
- Azure Administration and Governance
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

---

### ðŸ§  Future Projects
- **Azure Lab 1:** Secure Storage Account Deployment
- **Terraform Project 1:** Virtual Network and Subnet
- **Architecture Diagram 1:** Hub-and-Spoke Network

At the moment, Iâ€™m just setting up my GitHub portfolio so itâ€™s ready for when I start creating projects.
